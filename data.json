The language gives you all of the tools to easily and clearly express your ideas without a ton of overhead or boilerplate coding.  Keywords are short yet descriptive.  It's enormous library of framework and 3rd party libraries are incredibly consistent in formatting and style (casing, naming, etc) which makes using external dependencies much easier.  It strikes a great balance between languages that are overly verbose (ex. Java) and those that are so terse that they become cryptic (ex. Regular Expressions).  \n\nIt is strongly typed and object oriented language.  That means you will have to spend time defining classes and building out domain models.  It could just be a preference or my experience, but in most cases I find this a trivial amount of overhead for the benefits that strongly typed languages gives you.  \n\nVisual Studio (the primary IDE for developing in C#) is the best IDE on the market  in terms of out of the box features (keyword coloring, debuggers, webservers, intellisense, etc.) and usability (inline navigation, keyboard shortcuts, window docking) in my opinion.  There is a huge ecosystem of plugins and addons, for those that like more customization as well.\n\nThe downside is that it's not cross platform (yet) and the tools can be quite expensive.  The huge set of language features can also be a problem, since there are now many ways to solve the same problem.  The learning curve isn't too bad, but the inconsistency in approaches and styles can be tough to deal with."

However, there is a lot of boilerplate and \"ceremony\" that's unnecessary in newer languages, and some real warts that should have been fixed long ago.\n\nExplicit static typing makes it much easier to convince myself that a program is correct, and the good performance and ease of writing parallel code is a big plus."
